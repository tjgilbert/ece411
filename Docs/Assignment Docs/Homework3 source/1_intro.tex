\rhead{ \fancyplain{}{Introduction/Requirements} }

    \subsection{Objective}
    
     Create a portable and intuitive to use wireless charger for a mobile device \textit{(portable and intuitive are defined further in the Requirements section)}. The use of the product requires the user only to place their device on the charging station and their device will begin charging.
    
    \subsection{Needs Statement}
     The need for this technology is sufficed by the convenient enhancements upon wired chargers. Wireless chargers negate the need to plug and unplug the device. The technology can also help people with physical impairments that are unable to manipulate traditional charging cords.
     Wireless charging technology is also inherently more robust than a physical connector. Charging cords wear out and receptacles can be damaged by careless insertion.


\section{Requirements}

The purpose of the requirements document is to outline the direction of this project within the requirements of the \textit{ECE411} practicum. All of the requirements weighted \textit{Must} need to be satisfied in order to qualify as a minimum viable product. Requirements weighted \textit{Should} specify desired features, which should be realized before the products' final release, but are not necessary for the minimum function. \textit{May} requirements are convieniene features. Their inclusion is at the pleasure of the \textit{Must} and \textit{Should} requirements
