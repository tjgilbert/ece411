        8.1 & Orientation/location for device placement on charging unit is marked & Should & Marking the location for optimal charging will reduce the time to full charge\\ \hline
        8.2 & User able set up within 5 minutes without user manual by a college student & Should & This is a metric to decide if the device is user friendly \\ \hline
        8.3 & Base station will indicate when device is coupled/charging & Should & User feedback will increase confidence that the product is operating correctly                                \\ \hline
        8.4 & Base station will indicate when device is done charging & May& Further user feedback on charge state would would be a more obvious indication than having to check the phone \\ \hline
