    \subsection{Objective}
    This project will address a desire for wireless charging unit for a mobile phone or similar device. The charging unit will be portable and intuitive to use \textit{(portable and intuitive are defined further in the Requirements section)}. The basic use of the product requires the user to place their device on the charging unit pad. There will be no user inputs other than placing their device on the charging station.

    \subsection{Needs Statement}
     The need for this technology is sufficed by the convenient enhancements upon wired chargers. Wireless chargers are more convenient, because they negate the requirement of plugging and unplugging your device. The technology can also help people with physical impairments that are unable to manipulate traditional charging cords.
     Wireless charging technology is also inherently more robust than a physical connector. Charging cords and receptacles can wear out or be damaged by careless insertion.


\section{Requirements}

The purpose of the requirements document is to outline the direction of this project within the requirements of the \textit{ECE411} practicum. All of the requirements weighted \textit{Must} need to be satisfied in order to qualify as a minimum viable product. Requirements weighted \textit{Should} specify desired features, which should be realized before the products' final release, but are not necessary for the minimum function.
